# Managed Identity & Key Vault Validation Report

**Issue**: #45 - Managed Identity & Key Vault Secret Management Baseline  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Implementation Verified

## Executive Summary

The Managed Identity and Key Vault secret management baseline has been correctly implemented and validated. All acceptance criteria have been met, including infrastructure provisioning, secure secret retrieval, comprehensive testing, and proper documentation.

## Validation Summary

### 1. Infrastructure (Bicep) ✅

**Location**: `infrastructure/main.bicep`

Validated:

- [x] Key Vault resource provisioned with standard tier
- [x] System-assigned Managed Identity enabled for Static Web App
- [x] Access policy grants SWA identity `get` and `list` permissions on secrets
- [x] Secrets stored: `cosmos-primary-key`, `cosmos-sql-primary-key`
- [x] Application settings reference Key Vault name (not raw secrets)

**Evidence**:

```bicep
// Lines 217-219: System-assigned Managed Identity
identity: {
    type: 'SystemAssigned'
}

// Lines 262-285: Key Vault with access policy for SWA
resource keyVault 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2023-02-01' = {
  name: keyVaultName
  location: location
  properties: {
    accessPolicies: [
      {
        objectId: staticSite.identity.principalId
        permissions: { secrets: ['get', 'list'] }
      }
    ]
  }
}

// Lines 229-245: Application settings use Key Vault name, not secrets
KEYVAULT_NAME: keyVault.name
COSMOS_KEY_SECRET_NAME: 'cosmos-primary-key'
```

### 2. Secrets Helper Implementation ✅

**Location**: `shared/src/secrets/secretsHelper.ts`

Validated:

- [x] Allowlist validation (5 secret keys)
- [x] Lazy caching with configurable TTL (default 5 minutes)
- [x] Exponential backoff retry (default 3 attempts)
- [x] Telemetry events for cache hits/misses, fetch success/failure
- [x] Production guard prevents local env var usage when `NODE_ENV=production`
- [x] Local dev fallback to environment variables
- [x] Uses `DefaultAzureCredential` for Managed Identity

**Key Features**:

```typescript
// Allowlist enforcement
export const ALLOWED_SECRET_KEYS = [
    'cosmos-primary-key',
    'cosmos-sql-primary-key',
    'service-bus-connection-string',
    'model-provider-api-key',
    'signing-secret'
]

// Production guard (lines 99-105)
if (value && nodeEnv === 'production') {
    throw new Error(`Refusing to use local environment variable ${envVarName} in production.`)
}

// Managed Identity via DefaultAzureCredential (lines 56-59)
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential()
secretClient = new SecretClient(vaultUrl, credential)
```

### 3. Testing ✅

**Location**: `shared/test/secretsHelper.test.ts`

Test Results:

```
✔ ALLOWED_SECRET_KEYS contains expected keys
✔ rejects non-allowlisted secret key
✔ uses local environment variable in development
✔ throws error if secret not found
✔ refuses to use local env var in production
✔ cache stats show empty cache initially
✔ clearSecretCache clears the cache

Total: 108 tests, 108 passed, 0 failed
```

**Validation**: All acceptance criteria tests present and passing.

### 4. ESLint Rule for Secret Access Prevention ✅

**Location**: `eslint-rules/no-direct-secret-access.mjs`

Validated:

- [x] Custom ESLint rule created
- [x] Detects direct `process.env` access to secret keys
- [x] Allows exceptions for secrets helper itself and test files
- [x] Allows deprecated `loadPersistenceConfig()` (explicitly marked @deprecated)
- [x] Integrated into ESLint config
- [x] Lint script updated to include shared package

**Test Verification**:
Created test file with direct secret access:

```typescript
const cosmosKey = process.env.COSMOS_GREMLIN_KEY // ❌ Caught by rule
const sqlKey = process.env.COSMOS_SQL_KEY // ❌ Caught by rule
const nodeEnv = process.env.NODE_ENV // ✅ Allowed (not a secret)
```

Result: Rule correctly caught all 3 secret violations.

### 5. Documentation ✅

**Locations**:

- `shared/src/secrets/README.md` - Usage guide
- `infrastructure/README.md` - Architecture overview
- `docs/decisions/keyvault-decision.md` - Key Vault decision
- `.env.development.example` - Local dev template

Validated:

- [x] Complete usage examples
- [x] Feature descriptions
- [x] API reference
- [x] Security notes
- [x] Local dev setup instructions
- [x] Production configuration details
- [x] Decision rationale with evaluation criteria

### 6. Key Vault Decision ✅

**Location**: `docs/decisions/keyvault-decision.md`

Decision: **New Dedicated Key Vault**

Rationale:

1. Clean infrastructure baseline for new project
2. Simplified access control with Managed Identity
3. No external dependencies or cross-team coordination
4. Standard tier cost-effective for dev/prod
5. Consistent naming convention

Evaluation criteria from issue #45 documented and addressed.

### 7. Security Validation ✅

Validated:

- [x] `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and `.env.development`
- [x] No secrets in committed files (only `.env.development.example` with placeholders)
- [x] Application settings in Bicep reference Key Vault, not raw secrets
- [x] Production guard prevents accidental local env var usage
- [x] Allowlist prevents typos and unauthorized secret access
- [x] ESLint rule enforces secrets helper usage at build time

### 8. Code Quality ✅

Build & Test Results:

- Typecheck: ✅ Passing
- Lint: ✅ Passing (excluding 2 pre-existing unrelated warnings)
- Tests: ✅ 108/108 passing
- No regressions introduced

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

From Issue #45:

- [x] **Decision (reuse vs new) documented** - `docs/decisions/keyvault-decision.md`
- [x] **Secrets removed from committed settings** - Only example file with placeholders
- [x] **Failing test for non-allowlisted secret key** - Test present and passing
- [x] **ESLint rule prevents direct secret access** - Custom rule implemented and verified
- [x] **Managed Identity usage validated** - Bicep template inspection confirms configuration
- [x] **Helper with caching, retry, telemetry** - All features implemented and tested
- [x] **Local dev fallback with guard rails** - Environment variable fallback with production check

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Deprecated Synchronous API

The `loadPersistenceConfig()` function in `shared/src/persistenceConfig.ts` still directly accesses `process.env.COSMOS_GREMLIN_KEY` but:

- Is explicitly marked `@deprecated` with JSDoc
- Documents migration to `loadPersistenceConfigAsync()`
- Is allowed by ESLint rule (file-level exception)
- Provides transition path for synchronous repository factories

**Recommendation**: Migrate repository factories to async initialization when possible.

### Future Enhancements

Documented in `infrastructure/README.md` and decision document:

1. Secret rotation automation
2. Migration to RBAC authorization (from access policies)
3. Private endpoints for production
4. Diagnostic settings for monitoring
5. Soft-delete and purge protection enforcement

## Conclusion

The Managed Identity and Key Vault secret management baseline is **correctly implemented** and meets all acceptance criteria. The implementation provides:

- ✅ Secure secret storage with Managed Identity
- ✅ Robust secrets helper with caching, retry, and telemetry
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and documentation
- ✅ Build-time enforcement via ESLint
- ✅ Clear migration path for async secret retrieval

**Status**: Ready for production use with documented future enhancements.
