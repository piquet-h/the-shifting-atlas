# Exit Edge Invariants (Relocated)

Authoritative invariants now live in: `../concept/exits.md`.

Architecture facet summary (implementation-impact only):

1. Canonical direction uniqueness enforced per (fromLocationId, direction).
2. Reciprocity is optional; no implicit reverse creation.
3. Exit mutations do not affect location version counters.
4. Idempotent create/remove (no telemetry on noâ€‘op).
5. Telemetry events: `World.Exit.Created`, `World.Exit.Removed` (only on state change).
6. Directions normalized prior to persistence (see concept doc for full normalization + relative rules).
7. Destination existence validated; scanners report anomalies only.
8. Description layers unaffected by exit CRUD.

For data shape, creation/removal flows, and roadmap items refer to concept doc and developer workflow guide.

## Purpose

Guarantee traversal integrity, idempotent creation/removal, and clear semantics for movement logic & future AI generation.
