# Workspace Removal - Documentation Update Needed

**Date**: 2025-10-14

## Summary

The repository has been simplified by removing npm workspaces. Each package (shared, backend, frontend) now operates independently with its own `node_modules` directory.

## Key Changes

1. **No npm workspaces** - Root package.json no longer has `workspaces` field
2. **File-based dependencies** - Backend and frontend use `file:../shared` instead of workspace protocol
3. **Independent packages** - Each package can be built/tested/deployed in isolation
4. **Simplified scripts** - Root scripts use basic bash (`cd dir && npm run cmd`)
5. **Direct installs** - Each package runs `npm ci` independently

## Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies for all packages
cd shared && npm ci
cd backend && npm ci  
cd frontend && npm ci

# Build all packages
cd shared && npm run build
cd backend && npm run build
cd frontend && npm run build

# Or use root-level scripts
npm run build  # Runs build in sequence: shared -> backend -> frontend
```

## CI/CD Changes

All GitHub Actions workflows now:
- Install dependencies per package independently
- Don't use the `node-workspace-setup` action
- Use standard `cd` and `npm ci` commands

## Files Changed

- `package.json` (root) - Removed `workspaces` field
- `shared/package.json` - Added clean script using `rm -rf`
- `backend/package.json` - Changed dependency to `file:../shared`, updated scripts
- `frontend/package.json` - Changed dependency to `file:../shared`, updated scripts
- `backend/scripts/package-simple.mjs` - New simplified packaging script
- `tsconfig.json` files - Removed `composite` and `references`
- All `.github/workflows/*.yml` - Updated to install deps independently

## Documentation To Update

The following docs need updating to reflect the workspace removal:

- [ ] `docs/backend-build-walkthrough.md`
- [ ] `docs/backend-build-visual-summary.md`
- [ ] `docs/backend-build-quickref.md`
- [ ] `docs/README-BACKEND-BUILD.md`
- [ ] `docs/ci-cd.md`
- [ ] `docs/architecture/overview.md`
- [ ] `docs/developer-workflow/local-dev-setup.md`

## Benefits

1. **Simpler mental model** - No hoisting, no workspace protocol confusion
2. **Faster installs** - No need to install all workspace deps to work on one package
3. **Isolation** - Each package is truly independent
4. **Standard npm** - Uses only standard npm features (file: dependencies)
5. **Easier debugging** - Module resolution is straightforward
