# Design Document: Player Interaction & Intent Parsing

> STATUS: FUTURE / NOT IMPLEMENTED (2025-10-02). No intent schema, parser, or Managed API ingestion is implemented yet. This document is a specification only. Implementation is intentionally deferred until traversal + baseline telemetry are stable.

## Summary

This module defines how free‑form player text commands ("Defend myself from the dragon while I back out of the cavern and throw a gold coin behind it") are transformed into a structured, ordered, and partially validated set of atomic **Intents**. These intents drive authoritative world actions via the **Managed API** (API Management fronting the game services) with minimal latency suitable for real‑time, conversational play reminiscent of a human Dungeon Master.

Key principles:

- **Freedom First:** Players can mix tactics, narration, humor, and multi‑step plans in one input.
- **Deterministic Core:** Only validated, canonical intents are persisted as Event vertices; freeform text never directly changes world state.
- **Edge‑Optimized:** Primary parsing runs client-side (browser model + heuristics) to reduce round trips; Managed API endpoint adjudicates, clarifies, or escalates.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Heuristic + minimal schema first; local LLM extraction and server refinement later.
- **Auditability:** Every accepted command has a parse artifact (versioned schema + telemetry correlation IDs).

## Scope & Non‑Goals

In Scope (Phase progression):

- Text command ingestion → normalized structured Intents.
- Ordering & concurrency grouping (e.g., defend + move concurrently, then throw).
- Ambiguity detection + optional clarifying question generation.
- Managed API contract for submission & clarification loop.
- Telemetry events and evaluation metrics definitions.

Out of Scope (initial phases):

- Full tactical planning / optimization (deferred AI augmentation).
- Rich natural language negotiation or multi-turn dialogue memory beyond short context window.
- Automatic spell or item effect simulation (handled by downstream systems).
- Voice input / speech recognition (future extension layer).

## Conceptual Architecture

```
Player Input → (Client Heuristics + Local LLM Extraction) → ParsedCommand Draft
   ↓ (POST /player/command)
Managed API Intent Adjudicator → (Validation + Policy + Optional Server LLM Escalation) → Accepted Intents → Event Vertices / Queue
   ↘ (if ambiguities) Clarification Prompt (response cycles until resolved or timeout)
```

## Intent Data Model (Specification)

Each atomic **Intent** represents one actionable world operation.

### Verb Set (Initial Canonical Enum)

`move`, `attack`, `defend`, `throw`, `use_item`, `examine`, `communicate`, `emote`, `interact`, `flee`, `guard`, `cast_spell` (placeholder future). Additional verbs require doc amendment + tests before adoption.

### ParsedCommand Envelope

  playerId: string (GUID),
  createdAt: ISO8601,
  clientLatencyMs?: number,
  provenance?: { model?: string; heuristicRulesApplied: number; }
}
```

### AmbiguityIssue

| Field         | Description                                                                                                  |

## Managed API Contract

### Endpoint

`POST /player/command`

### Request (Client → API)

```
{
  "playerId": "<guid>",
  "rawText": "Defend myself...",
  "clientParse": { ...ParsedCommand },        // optional but strongly encouraged
  "clientContextVersion": "playerState-1",    // optimistic concurrency for state view
  "traceId": "<guid>"                         // for distributed telemetry correlation
}
```

### Response (200 OK – Accepted OR Clarification)

```
{
  "status": "accepted" | "needs_clarification" | "rejected",
  "acceptedIntents": Intent[],          // present if status=accepted or partial accept
  "pendingClarifications": [
     { "issueId": "a1", "prompt": "Which coin do you want to throw? (gold / silver)" }
  ],
  "escalated": boolean,                // server LLM refinement performed
  "serverAdjustments": {                // diff summary relative to clientParse
     "removedIntents": ["temp-id-3"],
     "modifiedIntents": [ { "id": "temp-id-2", "changes": ["direction"] } ]
  },
  "parseVersion": "1.0.0",
  "clarificationToken": "<opaque>"     // required for follow-up answers
}
```

### Clarification Follow-Up

`POST /player/command/clarify`

```

Response mirrors primary contract with updated acceptance.

### Error Codes (Non-200)

| HTTP | Code                    | Meaning                         |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 400  | `SCHEMA_INVALID`        | Client payload malformed.       |
| 409  | `STATE_STALE`           | Client context version too old. |
| 422  | `NO_ACTIONABLE_INTENTS` | All intents invalid / filtered. |
| 429  | `RATE_LIMIT`            | Command throughput exceeded.    |

## Parsing & Clarification Pipeline (Phases)

| Stage | Location   | Purpose                                                          | Output              |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| H1    | Client     | Heuristic tokenization (directions, verbs, quantities)           | Draft spans         |
| H2    | Client     | Entity / item candidate resolution (local cache)                 | Annotated spans     |
| L1    | Client     | Local LLM extraction (JSON, grammar constrained)                 | ParsedCommand draft |
| V1    | API        | Schema + canonical verb/direction validation                     | Normalized intents  |
| P1    | API        | Policy filtering (authorization, inventory presence)             | Filtered intents    |
| A1    | API        | Ambiguity assessment; mark critical vs non-critical              | Ambiguity list      |
| E1    | API\*      | (Conditional) Server LLM escalation for complex / low confidence | Refined intents     |
| C1    | Client/API | Clarification loop (interactive)                                 | Resolved or partial |
| F1    | API        | Final accept; enqueue world events                               | Event records       |

Escalation triggers: zero valid intents, more than the configured maximum number of intents (see `MAX_INTENTS_PER_COMMAND` in implementation), unresolved critical ambiguity after first pass, or average confidence below the configured threshold (see `MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` in implementation; default 0.55).

## Telemetry Events (Canonical Names)

All events added centrally (extend `telemetryEvents.ts` before implementation; no inline literals):

| Event                                 | Key Fields                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PlayerCommand.Received`              | rawLength, hasClientParse, traceId                       |
| `PlayerCommand.ParseSucceeded`        | intentCount, latencyMsClient, latencyMsServer, escalated |
| `PlayerCommand.ParseFailed`           | failurePhase, reasonCode                                 |
| `PlayerCommand.AmbiguityDetected`     | ambiguityCount, criticalCount                            |
| `PlayerCommand.ClarificationPrompted` | issueCount                                               |
| `PlayerCommand.ClarificationResolved` | remainingAmbiguities                                     |
| `PlayerCommand.IntentFiltered`        | verb, filterReason                                       |
| `PlayerCommand.Escalated`             | triggerReasons[]                                         |

## Safety & Guardrails

| Risk                           | Control                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Offensive / disallowed content | Client pre-filter + server policy classifier (reject or sanitize).                   |
| Hallucinated items/entities    | Cross-check against player inventory & location scope lists; downgrade to ambiguity. |
| Unauthorized actions           | Policy layer rejects intents requiring missing prerequisites (e.g., weapon).         |
| Prompt injection attempts      | Strip role/classic jailbreak markers before local model prompt.                      |
| Model drift / version mismatch | `parseVersion` + model ID logged; mismatch triggers warning telemetry.               |
| Excess complexity spam         | Hard cap intents per command (e.g., 8) + incremental penalty delay.                  |

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                      | Definition                             | Target (Initial) |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Intent Precision            | Correct intents / proposed intents     | ≥ 0.80           |
| Intent Recall               | Correct intents / gold intents         | ≥ 0.80           |
| Ordering Accuracy           | % commands with correct relative order | ≥ 0.75           |
| Concurrency Accuracy        | Correct concurrency sets / total       | ≥ 0.70           |
| Ambiguity Resolution Rate   | Ambiguities resolved within 1 round    | ≥ 0.60           |
| Median Client Parse Latency | H1–L1 time                             | < 350 ms (warm)  |
| Escalation Rate             | % commands requiring E1                | < 15%            |

## Phased Roadmap

| Phase | Goal                                     | Deliverables                                         |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| PI-0  | Baseline schema & heuristic only         | Intent spec, docs, telemetry stubs (no LLM)          |
| PI-1  | Local LLM extraction                     | Grammar-constrained JSON output, confidence scoring  |
| PI-2  | Managed API adjudication + clarification | Endpoint live, ambiguity loop                        |
| PI-3  | Server escalation model                  | Larger model refinement path                         |
| PI-4  | Contextual memory (short window)         | Pronoun / referent resolution across recent commands |

## Cross-Module Integration Notes

| Module                 | Integration                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Navigation & Traversal | Direction validator reused; movement intents become traversal events.                                         |
| AI Prompt Engineering  | Future server escalation & strategic planning prompts use existing assembly patterns & MCP tool access.       |
| Quest & Dialogue Trees | `communicate` & `interact` verbs feed dialogue / quest triggers when target entity is an NPC or quest object. |
| Multiplayer Mechanics  | Concurrency groups may interact with party coordination logic (e.g., synchronized defend + retreat).          |

## Open Questions

1. Do we persist clarifying dialogue transcripts for audit or discard after resolution? (Leaning: short-lived, hashed for metrics only.)
2. Should pronoun resolution ("hit it") live client-side or server-side to guarantee authoritative context? (Leaning: server for consistency.)
3. Minimum viable confidence threshold before forcing escalation? (Tunable; start 0.55.)
4. Are partial acceptances (execute safe intents while awaiting clarification for others) desirable for pacing? (Probably yes with clear UI.)
5. Should we unify `guard` and `defend` or keep both? (Collect telemetry; may alias.)

## Implementation Guardrails (When Work Begins)

- No direct world mutations from client parse; server re-validates everything.
- New verbs require: (1) doc update, (2) telemetry addition, (3) test vectors.
- Clarification prompts must be deterministic (no model creativity at first) to reduce latency & drift.
- All telemetry event names added centrally before emission (consistent with existing policy).
