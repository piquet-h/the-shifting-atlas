# **Design Document: AI Prompt Engineering**

> STATUS: FUTURE / NOT IMPLEMENTED (2025-09-21). No Azure OpenAI integration, prompt construction utilities, or parsing logic exist in the codebase yet. First AI usage will be postponed until core traversal + persistence are functional.

## **Vision**

This module powers the generative backbone of a persistent, MMO-scale text adventure that blends D&D mechanics with dynamic world generation. It enables players to co-create the world through play, with AI-driven location generation, item generation, dialogue trees, quest logic, and contextual continuity.

## **Overview**

The AI Prompt Engineering system constructs, conditions, and parses prompts that drive consistent and immersive world generation using Azure OpenAI. It ensures spatial, thematic, and narrative coherence across the game world, and integrates deeply with item systems, traversal logic, quest logic, NPC behavior, developer extensions, and persistent player identity.

## **Core Capabilities**

### Prompt Construction and Conditioning ⚙️

- Built dynamically from player actions, location metadata, traversal context, item state, quest status, NPC memory, and persistent player identity
- Inputs include vector hints, biome continuity, emotional tone, generation constraints, item-based modifiers, and player role tags
- Example: “Generate a new forest location approximately 10 units north of Whispering Glade. Nearby is Mossy Hollow. Ensure biome continuity and avoid naming conflicts.”

### Contextual Awareness and Continuity 🧭

- Reflects spatial relationships, mood, elevation, environmental features, NPC memory, and player role
- Exit descriptions match destination metadata
- Supports narrative stitching, environmental foreshadowing, and multiplayer consistency

### AI Response Parsing 🧠

- Extracts structured metadata: name, description, biome, mood, elevation, hazards, tags, item hooks, dialogue nodes
- Enables location generation, item placement, and quest dialogue population

### Generative Systems 🌱

#### Item Generation 🪙

- Descriptions, inscriptions, and lore hints use sensory language
- Flavor text adapts to world changes, quest outcomes, player reputation, and player role
- Rare items include historical references, faction ties, and environmental storytelling

#### Dialogue and Quest Trees 🗣️

- Dialogue nodes reflect emotional tone, player stats, alignment, prior interactions, and persistent role
- Supports deception, persuasion, intimidation, and empathy mechanics
- Quest trees include branching logic, dependencies, and dynamic availability
- NPC memory and relationships influence dialogue tone and quest access
- Fallback paths ensure graceful degradation

#### NPC Behavior 👥

- Emotional profiles, faction alignment, historical context, and relationship webs
- Dialogue style reflects personality traits and speech quirks
- NPCs access dynamic knowledge bases and lore hooks
- Temporal awareness enables seasonal and anniversary-based variation

#### Quest Lifecycle 🎯

- Generated from biome, faction, NPC context, player state, and player role
- Activated via dialogue, environmental triggers, or item acquisition
- Progression tracked through quest stages and world changes
- Resolution includes multiple outcomes based on choices and moral alignment
- Impacts NPC relationships, faction reputation, and future quest availability

### Anti-Griefing Mechanics 🚫

- Flags disruptive behavior: sabotaging quests, harassment, exploitation
- Reduces success rates, narrative richness, and interaction quality
- Propagates through prompt conditioning to influence NPC hostility, loot filtering, and emotional tone
- NPCs respond with suspicion, avoidance, or aggression
- Loot generation excludes rare or faction-tied items
- Dialogue and quest access reflect player reputation, history, and role

### Spatial and Temporal Integration 🗺️⏳

- Prompts influence directional heuristics and vector topology
- Location generation respects proximity thresholds and reuses nearby nodes
- Retroactive portals added with narrative justification
- Prompts reflect player-triggered changes (e.g., clearing vines, building bridges, looting items)
- AI updates descriptions to reflect world evolution and quest impact
- Each prompt and response annotated with timestamps, player IDs, and role tags

### Safety and Developer Extensions 🛡️🧑‍💻

- Prompts conditioned to avoid unsafe, offensive, or disruptive content
- Filters enforce tone, style, and thematic boundaries
- Developers can inject custom prompts for regions, quests, items, NPCs, and traversal puzzles
- Templates support biome seeding, vector fields, item hooks, dialogue nodes, and narrative flavor
- Safety validation ensures injected prompts respect spatial, factional, item, and role logic

## **System Interaction Flow** 🔄

[Player Input] ↓  
[Traversal Trigger, Item Use, Dialogue Initiation, or Quest Action] ↓  
[Prompt Construction] → Includes griefing flags, reputation score, behavioral history, and role tags ↓  
[Azure OpenAI] ↓  
[AI Response Parsing] → Filters rare items, adjusts NPC tone, restricts quest access ↓  
[Location Generation or Tailoring] + [Item Placement] + [Dialogue Tree Population] ↓  
[Graph Persistence] → [Cosmos DB] ↓  
[Temporal Tagging] → [World Evolution] ↓  
[Narrative Stitching] → Reflects diminished rewards and social consequences

## **Future Expansion** 🚀

- Pre-generated quest paths with prompt chaining and thematic continuity
- Branching logic and re-stitching for alternate routes
- NPC pathing using prompt-driven vector goals
- Multiplayer prompt conditioning for shared world
