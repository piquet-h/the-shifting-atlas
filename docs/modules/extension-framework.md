## Vision

To empower developers and creators to **expand the game world** with custom content, mechanics, and experiences — without breaking immersion, lore, or performance.  
The Extension Framework provides a **structured, modular set of APIs and tools** that allow safe, scalable, and creative additions to the core game, ensuring every extension feels like a natural part of the living world.

## Core Capabilities

### Quest & Dungeon Creation Tools

- Design **custom quests** with branching narratives, multiple outcomes, and player‑driven consequences.
- Build **dungeons** with unique layouts, hazards, puzzles, and reward structures.
- Integrate with world state so quest and dungeon outcomes can influence factions, events, or environments.

### Item & NPC Injection Interfaces

- Add new **items** with custom stats, rarity tiers, crafting recipes, and special effects.
- Introduce **NPCs** with dialogue trees, persistent memory, faction alignment, and AI‑driven behaviors.
- Support for **faction‑aware NPCs** that react dynamically to player reputation and world events.

### World Event Scripting

- Schedule **time‑based events**, invasions, or festivals.
- Trigger **environmental changes** such as weather shifts, disasters, or resource availability.
- Enable **faction control changes** and territory disputes as part of scripted or emergent events.

### Versioning & Sandbox Isolation

- Test extensions in **isolated environments** before live deployment.
- Manage **version compatibility** to prevent conflicts with core systems or other extensions.
- Rollback capabilities for safe iteration and recovery.

## Developer Experience

### Modular API Access

- Clear, well‑documented endpoints for interacting with quests, NPCs, items, and events.
- Secure authentication and permission controls for extension authors.

### Extension Discovery & Sharing

- In‑game marketplace or repository for community‑created extensions.
- Ratings, reviews, and feedback systems for quality control.

### World Integration Guidelines

- Lore consistency checks and thematic alignment tools.
- Performance profiling to ensure stability and scalability.

## Expanded Design Notes

| Capability            | Example Use Case                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Quest/Dungeon Tools   | A modder creates a branching questline where player choices determine which faction gains control of a border town |
| Item/NPC Injection    | Adding a legendary sword with a unique crafting chain and an NPC blacksmith tied to its lore                       |
| World Event Scripting | A seasonal festival that unlocks limited‑time quests and cosmetic rewards                                          |
| Versioning/Sandbox    | Testing a new dungeon’s AI pathfinding in isolation before release                                                 |

If you want, I can now **extend this page with a formal API schema** for the Extension Framework — mapping out endpoints, data structures, and integration hooks so it’s immediately developer‑ready for your MMO architecture.
