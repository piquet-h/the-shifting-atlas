# ðŸ“ˆ Economy & Trade Systems

## Vision

The economy is the living bloodstream of the world â€” a dynamic, player-influenced network of currency, goods, and services that evolves over time. It should reward exploration, ingenuity, and risk-taking, while remaining balanced and lore-consistent. From bustling marketplaces to shadowy smuggling rings, the system must feel **persistent, reactive, and interconnected**, ensuring that every trade, craft, and negotiation has tangible consequences in the world.

## Core Components

### 1. Currency & Resource Flow

- **Primary Currency**: Universally accepted coinage or credit system, with lore-grounded denominations.
- **Secondary/Regional Currencies**: Rare or localized tender for specific factions or territories.
- **Resource Flow Mapping**: Track where resources originate, how they move, and where they are consumed.
- **Currency Sinks & Faucets**: Balanced inflow/outflow to prevent inflation or scarcity spirals.

### 2. Marketplaces & Trade Hubs

- **Player-Driven Markets**: Auction houses, stalls, and barter systems.
- **NPC Vendors**: Stock influenced by local production, imports, and recent events.
- **Faction-Controlled Markets**: Prices and access tied to reputation or political standing.
- **Seasonal & Event Markets**: Temporary boosts in trade for festivals, wars, or disasters.

### 3. Dynamic Pricing & Supply-Demand Mechanics

- **Price Elasticity**: Goods fluctuate in value based on scarcity, demand, and player/NPC activity.
