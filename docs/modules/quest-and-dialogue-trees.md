# Design document: Quest & Dialogue Trees

## üéØ Vision:

Similar to the early Legend of Zelda series of text adventures, this game will leverage the Dungeons & Dragons game mechanics and combine it with a free form generative AI based open world adventure, allowing players to drop into the game at any point and leave at any time.

There will be an overlaying historical concept (think Lord of the Rings or Dragonlance Chronicles) along with multiple side quests and distinct adventure locations.

It is a completely immersive text world with its own currency, different fiefdoms and governing bodies, competing religions and beliefs and secret organisations with their own agenda.

Players will be free to create their own guilds and operate in this world in their own way.

Extension points will allow developers to create extensions to the world like unique quests, dungeons, or craft unique items.

## üß© Quest & Dialogue Trees Module Design

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Features

* Dialogue Branching Logic: Supports multi-path conversations with conditional branches based on player choices, stats, and prior interactions.
* Emotional Tone & Persuasion Mechanics: NPC responses vary based on emotional context, player charisma, and alignment. Includes support for deception, intimidation, and empathy checks.
* Quest Types: Includes fetch, escort, puzzle, assassination, diplomacy, moral dilemma, and faction betrayal quests.
* Quest Dependencies & Chaining: Quests can unlock, block, or alter other quests based on completion status, player decisions, and world state.
* NPC Memory & Relationship Tracking: NPCs remember player actions, dialogue history, and reputation. Relationships influence quest availability and dialogue tone.
* Dynamic Quest Availability: Quests appear or evolve based on player actions, faction reputation, environmental triggers, and time-based events.
* Quest Item Generation & Flavor Text Adaptation: Items generated for quests reflect the narrative arc, faction context, and player alignment. Flavor text adapts to quest outcomes.
* Developer APIs: Hooks for injecting custom quests, dialogue paths, NPCs, and branching logic. Includes support for modding and sandbox testing.
* Anti-Griefing Mechanics: Disruptive players will face reduced success rates, fewer interactions, and lower narrative engagement, discouraging griefing through diminished rewards.

### üß† Dialogue Tree Architecture

* Node-Based Structure: Each dialogue is composed of nodes representing NPC lines, player responses, and conditional branches.
* Condition Evaluation: Nodes evaluate conditions such as player stats, quest state, faction alignment, and prior choices.
* Emotional Modifiers: Nodes can carry emotional tags (e.g., angry, hopeful, suspicious) that influence NPC tone and future interactions.
* Memory Integration: Dialogue nodes can reference past events, player actions, and NPC memory to create continuity.
* Fallback Paths: If conditions are unmet, fallback dialogue ensures graceful degradation and narrative continuity.
* Generative AI Integration: Dialogue nodes can be dynamically generated using OpenAI models, allowing NPCs to respond contextually to player input, world state, and emotional tone. This supports emergent storytelling and infinite conversational depth.

### üßô NPC Attributes for Immersive Open World

To support a fully immersive open world with historical depth, NPCs require a rich set of attributes:

* Backstory & Historical Context: Each NPC has a personal history tied to world events, factions, and locations.
* Faction Alignment & Beliefs: NPCs hold political, religious, or ideological views that influence behavior and dialogue.
* Emotional Profile: Baseline emotional traits (e.g., stoic, volatile, empathetic) shape responses and relationship dynamics.
* Memory & Reputation Awareness: NPCs track player actions, quest outcomes, and social reputation across regions.
* Role & Occupation: Defines NPC function in the world (e.g., merchant, priest, rebel) and available interactions.
* Relationship Web: NPCs maintain connections to other characters, guilds, and factions, enabling cascading narrative effects.
* Dialogue Style & Voice: Personality-driven language patterns, speech quirks, and tone modulation for realism.
* Dynamic Knowledge Base: NPCs access evolving world data
