# Design Document: Multiplayer Mechanics

## Vision

Create a living, multiplayer world where collaboration, conflict, and shared storytelling evolve dynamically. Every party decision, combat encounter, and NPC interaction should feel meaningful‚Äîshaped by persistent context, adaptive AI, and player-driven consequences. The system should empower both casual adventurers and strategic roleplayers to co-create a rich, responsive narrative landscape.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Multiplayer Mechanics: Syncing player states, cooperative exploration

- Real-time state synchronization
- Party formation and shared objectives
- PvP and PvE mechanics
- Instance management and matchmaking

### Real-time state synchronization

- Real-time vs. async updates
- Shared quest progression and NPC memory
- Location syncing and party movement logic

### Party formation and shared objectives

- Invite/accept/kick flow
- Shared loot rules and quest objectives
- Role-based bonuses and synergy effects

### PvP and PvE mechanics

- Combat rules, stat scaling, and faction modifiers
- Instance logic for dungeons, arenas, and boss fights
- Reputation impact and griefing mitigation

### Instance management and matchmaking

## World State Layers & Synchronization

Multiplayer visibility of evolving locations leverages the **immutable base + additive layer** model defined in `navigation-and-traversal.md` and enriched via AI genesis (`ai-prompt-engineering.md`).

### Layer Categories (Read-Only to Clients)

| Layer Type  | Example                                | Sync Characteristics                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base        | Original location genesis description  | Cached aggressively; invalidates only on structural audit fixes |
| Event       | "A fresh barricade blocks the archway" | Propagated immediately (low TTL caching)                        |
| Faction     | "Banners of the Azure Sigil hang here" | Region-scope invalidation on faction shift                      |
| Seasonal    | "Lanterns glow for the Equinox"        | Preloaded via seasonal manifest                                 |
| Catastrophe | "Ash and embers swirl in the ruin"     | High-priority fan‚Äëout (push)                                    |
| Aftermath   | "Charred beams now cool in silence"    | Replaces catastrophe layer ordering, not base                   |

### Consistency Model

- **Location Snapshot**: Server composes ordered layers ‚Üí hash ‚Üí clients diff apply.
- **Delta Broadcast**: Only new/removed layer IDs + changed exit states.
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Player-authored micro-layers (future) require optimistic version; reject on mismatch.

### Traversal Event Flow (Simplified)

1. Player issues move.
2. Server validates `EXIT` (state=open, gating satisfied).
3. Movement committed; latency + network timing recorded via `Multiplayer.Movement.Latency`. If traversal reveals or creates an additive layer, emit `World.Layer.Added`.
4. Party sync: party members receive prioritized delta packet with new location hash and delta layers.

### Latency Targets (Aspirational)

| Operation                                   | p50      | p95      |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Movement round-trip (no genesis)            | < 250ms  | < 500ms  |
| Movement + on-demand genesis (new location) | < 1200ms | < 1800ms |
| Layer push fan-out (<= 500 subs)            | < 300ms  | < 650ms  |

### Anti-Griefing Integration

Griefing signals (quest sabotage, harassment patterns) reduce _layer publication privileges_ for player-authored overlays (future feature) without desynchronizing core structural updates.

### Telemetry (Multiplayer Scope)

Canonical events (see `shared/src/telemetryEvents.ts`; all emitted via `trackGameEventStrict`):

- `Multiplayer.LayerDelta.Sent` (layerCount, bytes, recipients)
- `Multiplayer.LocationSnapshot.HashMismatch` (clientHash, serverHash)
- `Multiplayer.Movement.Latency` (serverMs, networkMs)

### Open Considerations

- Regional batching of broadcast vs per-location micro-packets.
- Predictive prefetch of adjacent location layer sets for fast parties.
- Privacy gates for secret layers (individual vs group discovery state).
