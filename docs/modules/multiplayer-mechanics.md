# Design Document: Multiplayer Mechanics

## Vision

Create a living, multiplayer world where collaboration, conflict, and shared storytelling evolve dynamically. Every party decision, combat encounter, and NPC interaction should feel meaningful‚Äîshaped by persistent context, adaptive AI, and player-driven consequences. The system should empower both casual adventurers and strategic roleplayers to co-create a rich, responsive narrative landscape.
