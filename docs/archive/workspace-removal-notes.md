# (Archived) Workspace Removal - Documentation Update

**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: OUTDATED - This document described a transition phase that is now complete

## Historical Context

This document was created during the removal of npm workspaces from the repository. It described a temporary state where packages used `file:../shared` references.

## Current State (as of 2025-10-26)

The migration has been completed and the repository now uses:

1. **GitHub Packages registry** - `@piquet-h/shared` is published to npm.pkg.github.com
2. **Registry references** - Both backend and frontend reference shared via semver (e.g., `^0.3.17`)
3. **No file: references** - The file:../shared pattern was replaced with proper registry references

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` Section 12.1 for current package dependency rules.
