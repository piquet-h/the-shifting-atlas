# (Archived) Early Vision Press Summary

This file preserves a concise marketing-style snapshot of the original world pitch for historical context. It is **not** part of the maintained technical documentation set.

**Core Pillars (unchanged):**

-   Emergent, persistent text world shaped by players
-   Layered description system instead of destructive rewrites
-   Modular systems (traversal, lore, factions, quests, economy) brought online incrementally
-   Extension & safe AI tooling via MCP before autonomous mutation

For current architectural rationale see `../architecture/overview.md` and for gameplay module status see `../modules.md`.
