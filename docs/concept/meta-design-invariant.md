## Invariant

The game never tells the player how to behave.

It quietly rewards them for being the kind of character they said they were.

## Notes

- This invariant is **about agency**: the system should never scold, moralize, or “correct” the player.
- It is also **about incentives**: coherence-based rewards should encourage intentional play without punishments.
- It applies equally to role-play, guided, and fast-forward interaction speeds.
