## Essence

The Shifting Atlas rewards **intentional play**: being the kind of character you said you were.

Reward modulation is _not_ moral scoring. It is a coherence-weighted adjustment that encourages consistency without restricting agency.

## Reward philosophy

- **Reward consistency, not virtue**: Lawful Evil is not punished; Good is not privileged.
- **No random outcomes based on alignment**: alignment/coherence should never be an excuse for arbitrary results.
- **No behavior policing**: the game does not tell the player how to behave.

## Base rewards (unmodulated)

The system may award baseline progress/rewards for:

- exploration
- objectives
- combat
- social outcomes (where modeled)

**Invariant**: baseline rewards are earned from outcomes, not from narration style.

## Coherence-weighted modulation

If the game tracks a coherence score (see `./alignment-declaration-and-coherence.md`), it may apply a bounded modifier using one of two patterns:

### 1) Multiplier

A small multiplier applied to the baseline reward.

### 2) Bonus pool

A separate pool that accrues slowly when coherence is high and can be spent/awarded as occasional bonuses.

**Invariant**: Modulation is bounded and smooth (no sudden spikes, no single-turn penalties).

## What “reward” can mean

This concept intentionally does not require a single progression currency.

Depending on the subsystem, “reward” may include:

- XP (if an XP/leveling subsystem exists)
- reputation shifts
- titles and recognition
- access to opportunities (invitations, introductions)
- cosmetic/fictional recognition (codex entries)
- loot rarity bias (where loot exists)

**Invariant**: reward modulation must not become a hard gate that blocks actions.

## Drift handling

- Coherence should decay gradually when behavior and declaration diverge over long windows.
- The system does not automatically rewrite declared alignment.
- Persistent drift may trigger gentle narrative prompts rather than punishments.

## Guardrails

- No per-turn judgement.
- No “alignment violation” punishments.
- Minimum sample window before coherence meaningfully affects rewards.
- Anti-grief: modulation must be resilient to spam and low-effort loops (no profitable “fail spam” patterns).
