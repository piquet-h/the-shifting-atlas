# M0 Foundation Closure – Checklist & Sign-Off

**Closed By:** Copilot  
**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Status:** ✅ M1 Traversal Completed (2025-10-30); preparing for M2 Observability

## Pre-Closure Verification

### Code & Deployment

-   [x] `ping.ts` – Service liveness endpoint working
-   [x] `bootstrapPlayer.ts` – Idempotent GUID bootstrap implemented
-   [x] `playerRepository.ts` – Cosmos Gremlin upsert with revision tracking
-   [x] `secretsHelper.ts` – Key Vault integration via Managed Identity
-   [x] All unit tests passing (`npm test`)
-   [x] Azure Static Web App deployed and responding
-   [x] Cosmos containers created (players, inventory, layers, events)

### Documentation

-   [x] `roadmap.md` updated – M0 marked closed; M1 active
-   [x] `docs/milestones/M0-closure-summary.md` created – Comprehensive summary
-   [x] ADR-001 & ADR-002 cross-linked in architecture docs
-   [x] Infrastructure README reflects dual persistence design
-   [x] Copilot instructions finalized (Sections 0–19)

### Infrastructure

-   [x] Bicep templates validated (`bicep build` passes)
-   [x] App settings wired for Cosmos + Key Vault
-   [x] Managed Identity RBAC configured
-   [x] Health check endpoint operational

### Telemetry & Observability

-   [x] Telemetry event registry populated
-   [x] `trackGameEventStrict` enforces canonical names
-   [x] Build vs game telemetry segregated
-   [x] Correlation ID propagation verified

### Security

-   [x] Secrets allowlisted + cached
-   [x] No credentials in source (`.env.development` excluded from repo)
-   [x] externalId conflict detection tested
-   [x] Managed Identity replaces local secrets in production

## Summary of Completed Work

**19 issues closed.** Core accomplishments:

| Capability        | Implementation                   | Confidence |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Deployment & IaC  | Bicep templates + SWA deployed   | High       |
| Player Identity   | Idempotent GUID bootstrap        | High       |
| Persistence       | Cosmos dual (Gremlin + SQL)      | High       |
| Service Liveness  | Ping endpoint + telemetry        | High       |
| Security Baseline | Managed Identity + Key Vault     | High       |
| Testing           | Unit tests + smoke scripts       | High       |
| Observability     | Event registry + correlation IDs | High       |

**Outstanding M1 items (not blockers):**

-   EXIT edge model (#5)
-   Movement command routing (#6)
-   LOOK command (#9)
-   Direction normalization enhancements (#13)

---

## Transition Checkpoint

### M0 → M1 Readiness

-   [x] Player bootstrap works consistently
-   [x] Telemetry infrastructure in place
-   [x] Persistence layers durable
-   [x] Infrastructure stable
-   ✅ **Ready to implement movement/traversal**

### M1 Kickoff

**Focus:** Player can move across ≥3 persisted locations with success/failure telemetry.

**Immediate tasks:**

1. Implement EXIT edge model (directional traversal)
2. Wire movement HTTP function routing
3. Implement LOOK command (location + exits display)
4. Enhance direction normalizer (N1: shortcuts/typos)

**Timeline:** Ready to start immediately.

## Sign-Off

**M0 Foundation Milestone Closed:** ✅ 2025-10-19

All exit criteria verified. Deployment stable. M1 Traversal subsequently completed (2025-10-30).

**Next Milestone:** [M2 Observability](../roadmap.md#m2-observability)
