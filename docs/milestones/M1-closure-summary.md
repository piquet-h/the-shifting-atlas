# M1 Traversal Milestone – Closure Summary

**Closed:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** ✅ All exit criteria met

## Exit Criteria Verification

| Criterion                                                  | Status | Evidence (Summary)                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Player can move across ≥3 persisted locations              | ✅     | E2E traversal loop smoke tests; seed script with ≥3 linked locations       |
| Telemetry for move success/failure                         | ✅     | `Location.Move` events (success/blocked) + correlation IDs in App Insights |
| Persistent player-location tracking (scalar or edge-based) | ✅     | Player-location edge model implemented; scalar fallback phased out (#131)  |

## Core Accomplishments

-   Traversal loop stabilized (bootstrap → look → move → look)
-   Exit management lifecycle (create, reciprocal, remove, cache invalidation, consistency scan)
-   Direction normalization (N1 canonicalization + shortcuts) integrated
-   Exits summary caching for efficient LOOK responses
-   Player-location edges enable location population queries (foundation for M2 analytics)
-   Telemetry coverage: navigation events, exit creation/removal, movement success/failure
-   Architecture + documentation alignment epics closed (design debt reduced early)

## Key Decisions

1. Adopt edge-based player-location model to unify spatial queries (future NPC & party features).
2. Maintain deterministic compass ordering for exits for user-facing summary consistency.
3. Defer semantic & relative direction support (N2/N3) to enrichment phase (align with layering & UX polish).
4. Preserve dual-write migration logs for audit until full edge adoption confirmed; then retire scalar field.

## Deferred / Moved to Future Milestones

| Item                                  | Target Milestone           | Rationale                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Semantic exits (named landmarks)      | M4 Layering & Enrichment   | Tied to descriptive world layering              |
| Relative directions (left/right)      | Post-M4 (after semantic)   | Depends on semantic anchor resolution           |
| Advanced exit management service      | M2/M3 (observability hook) | Needs metrics & operational telemetry first     |
| Extended direction ambiguity handling | M3 AI Read                 | Coordinate with AI prompt context normalization |

## Telemetry Snapshot

Navigation events now power preliminary move success dashboards (basis for M2 Observability focus). Event cardinality acceptable; no high-churn unregistered events detected by validator.

## Risks Retired

| Risk                              | Retirement Reason                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Movement concurrency (race)       | Edge model + repository guards validated in tests |
| Cache invalidation inconsistency  | Deterministic invalidation path exercised         |
| Direction normalization overreach | Conservative edit distance & shortcut set stable  |

## Follow-Up Recommendations (Entering M2)

1. Instrument per-location population metrics (build on player-location edges).
2. Enhance RU/latency wrappers with percentile aggregation.
3. Expand telemetry validator to enforce event property schemas.
4. Begin layering observability for traversal failure reasons (missing exit vs blocked state).

## Documentation Updated

-   `roadmap.md` marked M1 CLOSED; focus shifted to M2 Observability.
-   `M1-implementation-plan.md` archived with closure reference.
-   M0 closure docs updated to point to M2.
