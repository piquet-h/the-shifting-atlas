/**
 * Test World Seeding Helper
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Provides test-specific wrapper around production seedWorld function
 * - Reduces duplication between integration and E2E test world setup
 * - Offers default test location blueprints
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Integration tests: Use with in-memory repositories for fast tests
 * - E2E tests: Use with real Cosmos repositories for production validation

 * Default test location blueprint - 5-location graph for basic traversal testing

 * - Hub (center) with 4 exits (N/S/E/W)
 * - North room (1 exit back south)
 * - South room (1 exit back north)
 * - East room (2 exits: west to hub, north to north room)
 * - West room (1 exit back east)

 * Enables testing:
 * - Multi-hop traversal
 * - Reciprocal exits
 * - Multiple paths to same destination
 * - Exit validation (missing exits)

/**
 * Default test location blueprint used across all test layers
 *
 * Design:
 * - Hub location with 4 exits (north, south, east, west)
 * - Each direction leads to a unique location
 * - Locations have return paths to hub
 * - East location has additional path to north (multi-hop testing)
 *
 * ID Strategy:
 * - Integration tests: Use IDs as-is (in-memory, no cleanup needed)
 * - E2E tests: Use same structure with 'e2e-' prefix via getE2ETestLocations()
 *
 * This unified structure ensures consistent test behavior across layers.
