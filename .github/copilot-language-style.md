# Copilot Language & Style Guide

Single source for per-language generation hints. Keep this concise; link here instead of embedding long rationale blocks in settings or other instruction files.

## Global Principles

- Prefer TypeScript for new backend/frontend code; JavaScript only for minimal bootstrap scripts.
- ES Modules everywhere; no CommonJS.
- Use async/await for all I/O.
- Keep functions small, composable, pure where practical.
- Telemetry/event names must come from shared constants (never inline literal strings).

## Tooling Precedence (Authoritative Style Stack)

1. Prettier formats code automatically. Do NOT handcraft alternate spacing, semicolons, or wrapping beyond what Prettier emits.
2. ESLint enforces correctness + selective stylistic gaps not covered by Prettier (domain rules, a11y, telemetry custom rules).
3. TypeScript compiler provides typing / structural guarantees; avoid suppressing errors with `any` or `// @ts-ignore` unless documented.
4. Domain & architectural conventions (this guide + compact guide) sit above for design decisions, not micro‑formatting.

Copilot: When generating code, assume Prettier will post-process; emit code already matching its settings to reduce churn.

## Formatting (Driven by Prettier)

| Setting          | Value               | Intent                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `printWidth`     | 140                 | Favor wider lines given domain naming & telemetry constants |
| `tabWidth`       | 4 (YAML override 2) | Readability + explicit nesting; YAML conventional 2         |
| `useTabs`        | false               | Spaces for alignment in mixed environments                  |
| `singleQuote`    | true                | Consistent JS/TS string style                               |
| `trailingComma`  | none                | Minimize noisy diff churn                                   |
| `semi`           | false               | Cleaner minimal syntax (ES modules)                         |
| `arrowParens`    | always              | Explicit clarity for single params                          |
| `bracketSpacing` | true                | Improve object readability                                  |

YAML: inherit indentation 2 spaces via Prettier override.

Copilot MUST:

- Omit semicolons at statement ends.
- Use single quotes for strings (except JSON / YAML / Markdown code fences where double quotes may be required or canonical).
- Wrap arrow function params in parentheses even if single.
- Avoid adding trailing commas.
- Use 4-space indentation (2 in YAML) and respect 140 column soft wrap.

Avoid reflowing long narrative strings; prefer template literals only when interpolation or multi-line formatting is required.

## Naming & Patterns

| Concern                | Convention             | Example                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Azure Function (HTTP)  | `Http<Verb><Domain>`   | `HttpMovePlayer`        |
| Azure Function (Queue) | `Queue<Process><Item>` | `QueueProcessNPCStep`   |
| Domain Models          | Nouns, singular        | `Player`, `Location`    |
| Utility Modules        | verb-noun kebab        | `validate-direction.ts` |

## TypeScript / JavaScript

- Always add explicit return types on exported functions.
- Narrow unknown/any at boundaries only; avoid propagating `any`.
- Prefer discriminated unions over enums when modeling state progressions.
- Avoid default exports.
- For React (frontend): Functional components, hooks; no legacy class components.
- Keep side effects isolated (initialization modules or Function triggers).
- Prefer named imports/exports; avoid default exports for clearer refactors.
- Avoid broad barrel files unless they demonstrably reduce import churn without circular deps.

### Error Handling

- Throw domain-specific errors (extend `Error`) at boundaries; map to HTTP status in HTTP triggers.
- Avoid swallowing errors—log with telemetry helper including correlation ID.

## React / JSX / TSX

- Co-locate component + styles (Tailwind utility classes inline; no separate SCSS).
- Use semantic HTML; accessibility (aria attributes) for interactive elements.
- Keep components ≤ ~150 lines; split when state/effect complexity grows.

## Markdown

- Keep lines wrapped at ~100 chars for readability unless tables or code blocks.
- Use reference links for repeated URLs.
- Prefer linking design docs instead of duplicating large narrative blocks.

## JSON / YAML

- Structural data only; no comments inside JSON (use adjacent README if rationale needed).
- YAML indentation: 2 spaces, no tabs.
- Stable key ordering for config to reduce diff churn.

## Shell (sh)

- Target POSIX sh compatibility where feasible; avoid Bash-only features unless required.
- `set -euo pipefail` at top for non-trivial scripts.
- Quote all variable expansions (`"$VAR"`).

## MJS / MTS

- Use `.mts` for TypeScript ESM modules where Node resolution benefits, else `.ts`.
- Use `.mjs` only for runtime JavaScript modules that must remain JS (tooling constraints).

## Copilot Inline Suggestion Policy

| Language         | Inline Suggestions  | Rationale                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript / TSX | Enabled             | High velocity, patterns benefit from AI scaffolding |
| JavaScript / JSX | Enabled             | Similar to TS where types not required              |
| Markdown         | Disabled by default | Reduce distraction while writing prose              |
| JSON / YAML      | Enabled             | Structural key/value scaffolding helpful            |
| Shell            | Enabled             | Quick command snippet generation                    |

## Implementation Order Awareness

When generating plans, sort candidate tasks by (1) lowest Implementation order, (2) earliest milestone, (3) scope priority: `core > world > traversal > ai > others`.

## Anti-Patterns (Reject Suggestions That)

- Insert polling loops instead of queue triggers.
- Hardcode telemetry event names.
- Duplicate scope/type labels or suggest legacy label prefixes.
- Inline large lore/story blocks—reference docs instead.

## When Unsure

Prefer a minimal, well-typed stub + TODO with pointer to relevant doc rather than guessing domain logic.
