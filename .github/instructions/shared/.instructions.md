# Shared package instructions (`@piquet-h/shared`)

These rules apply to anything under `shared/`.

## Scope & boundaries

- `shared/` is the **published** domain/core package consumed by backend, frontend, and tooling.
- Keep it **pure** and portable:
    - ✅ allowed: domain types, schemas, constants/enums, pure utilities
    - ❌ forbidden: Azure SDK usage, Functions bindings, persistence implementations, direct secret access, `process.env` access

Authoritative boundary rules live in `shared/README.md`.

## Versioning & cross-package workflow

- If you change public exports or behavior consumed by other packages:
    - bump `shared/package.json`
    - add/update tests
- Do **not** update backend/frontend to consume unpublished shared changes in the same PR unless it’s explicitly confirmed to be safe.

## Dependency safety

- Backend/frontend must depend on `@piquet-h/shared` via the registry (never `file:` references).

## Formatting & Code Style

Prettier is the authoritative formatter. If any prettier errors appear:

```bash
# Auto-fix all prettier formatting errors
npm run format:shared  # from repo root
# OR
npm run format        # from shared/ directory
```

Do NOT manually edit to fix "Delete", "Add", or spacing errors—prettier handles these automatically. After running format, stage and commit the changes.

## Verification gate (CI must be green)

For any change under `shared/`, you MUST ensure these checks pass before considering work "done":

- Format: `npm run format:check:shared` (repo root) OR `npm run format:check` (in `shared/`) – must have no prettier errors
- Lint: `npm run lint:shared` (repo root) OR `npm run lint` (in `shared/`)
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck:shared` (repo root) OR `npm run typecheck` (in `shared/`)

If CI fails for format/lint/typecheck/tests, you MUST push follow-up commits until required checks are green.
