description: Documentation editing rules for files under docs/
applyTo: 'docs/**'
---

Follow documentation-specific guidance in `docs/AGENTS.md`.

Key rules (docs-only):

- Keep docs MECE by layer (Vision/Tenets/Design Modules/Architecture/Roadmap/Examples/Code).
- Avoid planning leakage in `docs/design-modules/` and `docs/concept/`.
- Prefer relative links; do not duplicate large blocks across layers.
- Do not change runtime code when asked to update docs unless explicitly requested.
