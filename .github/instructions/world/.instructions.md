# World prompt authoring instructions

These instructions are intentionally small and scoped to prompt code in `shared/src/prompts/**`.

## Source of truth

- World rules and lore live in `docs/` (do not re-embed lore walls in prompt code).
- Use the shared prompt modules (for example: `shared/src/prompts/worldTemplates.ts`) and keep them reusable.

## Guardrails

- Prefer referencing doc filenames/sections over copying prose.
- Keep prompt templates versioned and composable.
- Avoid introducing new high-cardinality telemetry names from prompt code.

## Deeper guidance (on-demand)

Use the Agent Skill in `.github/skills/world-content-generation/` for detailed world content generation procedures and examples.
